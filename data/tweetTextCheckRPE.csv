4517,I explain to him that the attacks trace back to his botnet, not the customer. I further explain that financial institutions are designated critical infrastructure in the UK, so attacks against them are considered less of a criminal issues and more a national security one.,,,,,,,,,
4518,One day we got a notification that a DDoS attack had been launched at one of the largest banks in the UK. We check their website and sure enough, it was toast. There was little we could do to take out the botnet itself, due to its complex infrastructure, so we waited.,,,,,,,,
4519,"I already knew the botnet operator's contact info from my digging into him, so I thought to myself ""what if I can just ask him nicely to stop?"". I reached out and explained that i knew he's not launching attacks himself, only selling access to customers.",,,,,,,,,,,
4520,I was able to get traffic stats from a couple of the victim's ISPs and the attacks ranged from 100 to 600 Gbps, with some attacks exceeding 200m pps. This botnet was no joke, it was the kind capable of knocking offline entire datacenters.,,,,,,,,,
4521,Based on attack patterns it looked as if the owner was running a DDoS-for-Hire service, but the high price point meant it appealed to more sophisticated attackers, rather than scriptkiddies.,,,,,,,,,
4522,We started noticing a particular botnet which had much more sophisticated infrastructure than the others, and it was spreading at a significantly higher rate. Whoever was operating it wasn't your average scriptkiddie, so we did some digging into him.,,,,,,,,,
4523,A friend and I developed an automated platform for finding botnets based on the Mirai source code and extracting their control server address. We'd feed the information into a system which would monitor their control servers and notify us of any DDoS attacks they launched.,,,,,,,,,,,
