158,I could launch ETAbyte attacks as well  but that's just Trump behavior. Obsolete. We are under permanent man in the middle attacks without noticing. DDOS is the real weapon for stealing data spoofing Mac address cloning. Let me upload my latest video.
159,Yet it's an open network without any encryption. Man in the middle is the most powerful weapon of hackers apart from DDOS. There is no working DOS protection if your carrier or your router is vulnerable and both are vulnerable. I easily overload a cheap router with 10 TB/s sniffing
160,With a giant botnet you can brute Force it yet that remains trial and error. If the targeted person uses a strong password it can easily take years to crack it. So why bother with encryption if nobody wonders why the WiFi is unstable? When you are close to your router..
